Six monuments and more than a hundred viewpoints show how the Via Appia Antica was seen by artists and photographers over time.

The Via Appia Online Viewer (2022) is a follow to the project [“A 3D spatial data infrastructure for *Mapping the Via Appia*”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221205481630008X?via%3Dihub#!), which is an interactive journey through time along the Roman Appian Way, one of the world's oldest roads. The project called REVISITED Via Appia will be presented at the ***het Valkhof Museum  in Nijmegen (The Netherlands, [link to the exposition memo](https://www.museumhetvalkhof.nl/zien-en-doen/tentoonstellingen/revisited-via-appia/))*** with a gamified online version accessible to everyone. 

The exhibition connects the results of years of academic and artistic research and offers a refreshing perspective on the 'Regina viarum' (queen of the roads), to follow in the footsteps of the millions of people who have walked there since Roman times and see how the road has changed over time.
