## Build Setup

Enable `eslint --fix on file save` in your code editor.

```bash

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

Archeological pointcloud viewer for use in a museum setting. Based on storylines (narratives) that are defined by an artist or expert, a user should be able to view multiple _storylines_ , all consisting of multiple _pages_.

## high resolution pointcloud locally:

You need to download and place the pointclouds data into the `/static/pointclouds/highres`.  
The structure looks like:

## Upload the PointCloud data in cloud storage

*   You need to have installed locally [gsutils](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install)
*   log in you google account to get writing permissions
*   Navigate to the root where the data folder is placed and start the copy of the files to the google cloud storage: 

```shell
gsutil -m cp -r ./data gs://via-appia-20540.appspot.com
```

*   Â Access the cloud storage dashboard [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/via-appia-20540.appspot.com)

# Enable settings locally

You can change local setting by creating a `.env` file and enabling the settings you want to have:

```shell
LOCAL_POINTCLUDS = true
POINTS_BUDGET = 1000000
```

## Converting big LAS files to LAZ and viewing it in Potree Desktop

To make things easier you can use windows. it is possible to compile the PotreeConverter and LasZIP for Linux and Mac but you have to do it yourself.

### What you need:

*   Your LAS files, (in our case has been a 17GB size files).
*   Lastools
    *   Download here https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/     
*   PotreeConverter
    *   Download here [PotreeConverter\_1.7\_windows\_x64.zip](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter/releases/tag/1.7)
*   Potree Desktop (optional, use it to test your converted files)
    *   Web: [https://github.com/potree/PotreeDesktop/releases/tag/1.8](https://github.com/potree/PotreeDesktop/releases/tag/1.8)
    *   File: [**PotreeDesktop\_1.8\_windows\_x64.zip**](https://github.com/potree/PotreeDesktop/releases/download/1.8/PotreeDesktop_1.8_windows_x64.zip)

First we need to merge the various .las files into one file. To do so we use lastools browse to the bin folder and run 

`las2las -i C:\\...\\001.las C:\\...\\002.las C:\\...\\003.las ... -merged -o C:\\...\\merged.las`   

Only PotreeConverter 1.7 is able to compress the merged LAS file. It will result in many small files. PotreeConvert 2 only uses one file, but it doesn't compress, so the resulting point cloud will be as big as the original LAS.

Navigate to the folder where PotreeConverter is, and run the command (replace the \<names>):

`./PotreeConverter.exe .\<fileName>.laz -o ./<outputDirectory> --output-format LAZ`

Once the process has finished, you can drag and drop the new output directory to PotreeDesktop 1.8.
